                <p class="chapter-title" >INTRODUCTION <br></p>
                <p class="chapter-text">In recent years <b>drone</b> and <b>LIDAR</b> technology have advanced to the point of threatening to completely overtake <b>aero
                    photogrammetry</b>. However there are still some factors that have hampered the process of the construction industry
                    fully
                    embracing this new technology with perhaps the most critical being the current price tag and the technical
                    expertise
                    required for the maintenance that accompanies long-range LIDAR equipment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The purpose of our research is to tackle these problems, both economic and technical, by offering a third
                    alternative
                    for site surveying with the use of a SLAM equipped drone that applies multiple depth cameras both expanding and
                    strengthening the field that the drone could map, obtaining an accurate survey of a site, with the final goal of
                    integrating FPV (first-person view) capabilities and MIXED REALITY applications to the drone making it possible
                    to
                    virtually project structures into the real world overlapping the live feed from the drone and visualize them
                    using VR
                    googles.

                    style="width: 400px; height: auto"> <br>
                <p class="chapter-text">We believe that it will be possible to make a prototype that could become a viable alternative with capabilities
                    of
                    precise scanning and through the aid of simultaneous photography apply an AI module for semantic segmentation
                    that will
                    label the elements in a site such as trees, terrain materials, and existing buildings and input this information
                    so that
                    a more accurate 3d reconstruction can be made.
            
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The “SLAM UAV drone” will then interpret the data from geo-positional information combining it with mapped data
                    and the
                    labeling component, to produce a virtual 3-dimensional representation of the site in a process guided towards
                    predicting
                    a theoretical ideal placing of a building, on the targeted site, using a multi-objective optimization process
                    powered by
                    the AI module holding the understanding of the components of the site and processed on the onboard computer
                    attached to
                    the drone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This drone prototype and the software that will accompany this equipment could theoretically enable any
                    architect or
                    design team to first accurately survey a site and process the data into a functional virtual twin so that on the
                    following flight, of the drone overlooking the site, it would be possible to simulate a new planned structure or
                    building on the site and in real-time see it, through the drone camera, from any desired height and angle
                    contributing
                    greatly to the understanding of the impact of said structure on a context obtaining new insights for further
                    refining
                    its design. In other words, this application can be used in the exploratory design phases as well as to present
                    the
                    final design to a client.

                <p class="chapter-text">“SLAM UAV drone” is a prototype created by a team led by professor Diego Thomas from the Information Science department
                at Kyushu University and jointly being developed with the aid of a team from the Architectural lighting laboratory led
                by Professor Yasuko Koga from the Environmental Engineering department at Kyushu University.</p>

                <p class="chapter-title"> <br> COMPARISON OF ANALYSIS BETWEEN LIDAR, PHOTOGRAMMETRY, AND SLAM UAV DRONE <br></p>
                <p class="chapter-text">To accurately measure the potential of a SLAM UAV drone prototype it was decided that a practical approach would be to
                judge the results based on the comparison with the data obtained from surveying a target site using ground Lidar and
                aero photogrammetry, the most common and available methods in the market. This comparison will then be interpreted
                ideally in the form of a measurable deviation that will allow to more accurately pinpoint where would this prototype be
                allocated when compared to these two methodologies in terms of several factors such as accuracy, time constraint,
                economical value, among others to be decided.
                
                The initial site chosen for our tests will be near the west 2 building on campus and it would be the location that we
                are targeting for survey using the ground-level equipment as well as photogrammetry using PIX4D mapper.</p>
