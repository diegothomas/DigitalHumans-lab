                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Thank you for reading this abstract. For real, there will be many equations but please come to my presentation, I will do my best to make it easy to follow. Geometric algebras can be understood as a set of very intuitive tools to represent, construct and manipulate geometric objects. This talk is an introduction to the domain, and thus no mathematical background is required. Moreover, this presentation aims to keep all concepts as simple and intuitive as possible. The plan of the talk will follow this guideline: first introduce the main concepts of geometric algebra such as outer product, geometric product or multivectors. Then I will present some specific algebras that find applications in computer sciences. Then I will introduce some geometric transformations that generalise quaternions and dual quaternions on these objects. </p>

                <h2>About Vincent</h2>
                  
                <p>Vincent Nozick get his PhD in 2006 at Universite Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallee (France) at the Laboratoire d'Informatique Gaspard Monge (LIGM). In 2006, he has been laureate of a Lavoisier fellowship for a post-doc position at Prof. Hideo Saito laboratory, Keio University. Then, he was hired as a tenured "maitre de conferences" at Universite Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallee (France) from 2008. He served as the head master of the Imac engineer school from 2011 to 2013. From 2016 to 2018, he get a sabbatical at Japanese French Laboratory for Informatics (JFLI) at the National Institute of Informatics, Keio University and the University of Tokyo. In addition to computer vision applications, his current researches focus on both digital image forensics and geometric algebra.</p>
